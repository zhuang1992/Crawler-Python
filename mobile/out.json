Kanaleneiland's reputation is gradually improving and due to the influx of musicians, artists and young talent the neighborhood is now turning into a creative hotspot. VOLHARD is the second music album of the collective, on which nearly fifty musicians from Utrecht joined forces in new collaborations. The songs are written in honor of the 4th and 5th of May, the days on which the Netherlands commemorate those who died in war and subsequently celebrate the country's freedom. &lsquo;Volhard&rsquo; is a play on words; it comes from the Dutch word for perseverance but also implicates &lsquo;full heart&rsquo;."], "name": ["Knalland - Volhard (MP3 & VIDEO)"]},
